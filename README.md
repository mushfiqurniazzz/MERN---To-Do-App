It uses MongoDB as the database to store todo data, Express.js for handling server-side logic, React.js for building the user interface, Firebase authentication method and Node.js for server-side runtime environment. The app provides a seamless experience for users to organize and track their tasks efficiently.</p>
<h3>Running the Project Locally</h3>
  <p>To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. <b>Clone the Repository</b>: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/mushfiqurniazzz/MERN---To-Do-App

2. <b>Navigate to Project Directory</b>: Move into the project directory:

   cd backend || frontend

3. <b>Install Dependencies</b>: Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

   npm install

   or

   yarn

4. <b>Setup Environment Variables</b>: Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the variables mentioned in the `.env.sample`

5. <b>Start the Development Server</b>: Run the following command to start the development server:

   npm start

6. <b>Access the App</b>: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000[server], http://localhost:5173[frontend]` to access the app. You can now use the app locally on your machine, connected to your MongoDB database using the URI specified in the `.env` file.

7. <b>Note</b>: The project may not work if you do not install dependencies in both front end and backend. So you would have to apply step 2 and 3 twice, once in frontend and once in backend.
